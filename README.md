API Testing:
API Testing is a software testing type that validates Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The purpose of API Testing is to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the programming interfaces. In API Testing, instead of using standard user inputs(keyboard) and outputs, you use software to send calls to the API, get output, and note down the systemâ€™s response.

The entire web is functioning with the help of HTTP requests and response protocol and the backbone of the HTTP requests is an HTTP method.

Tools used:
Postman is preferrable for Manual testing.
For Automation testing, Eclipse with Native Java(Standard HttpURLconnection) and third-party libraries like Apache HttpClient library,unirest,google http client, rest assured will be used.
